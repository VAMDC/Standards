XSAMS Process Codes

Introduction
------------------

In order to facilitate searching and sorting XSAMS files or blocks of data
within a file, a classification scheme is defined to provide standard
definitions for the fundamental process that is being described (e.g., the
reflection of a particle from a surface or the excitation of an atomic
state). 

The process codes are "fundamental" in that they do not define the reactions
to a great degree of detail that is carried out by specific elements of the
overall schema.  Rather, they provide a high level identification that can be
used to aggregate similar data or provide a simple search point.  


Process Codes
-----------------

The following table defines the fundamental reactant codes.  The process codes
embody a high level description and a much more complete definition of the
process that data pertain to is contained in the elements of the full schema. 
Processes are split into two categories: collisions (electron and heavy
particle collisions) and particle surface interactions (PSI).  Within each
category, the codes are intended for use with any reactant.  For example, a
single process code is used to describe elastic scattering whatever is the
projectile (electron, photon, atom, ion or molecule).

This approach has been taken not only for economy but because an exhaustive
list of processes involving elementary particles, atoms, molecules, and solids
is not likely possible.  Even if it were, using it would be cumbersome in that
some non-intuitive coding would be necessary, for example, to encode inverse
bremstrahlung, sublimation of water from a dust grain, a production of an
atomic inner shell vacancy with a subsequent Coster-Kronig decay, etc. 

Multiple process codes can be given in order to build more complex
descriptions from the fundamental processes, e.g., charge transfer +
ionization in ion-atom collisions could be described by the code for
ionization (liberation of an electron from the target or projectile to the
continuum) and the code for charge transfer (the transfer of an electron from
one collision partner to another). This combining of individual codes avoids
the need for a code for all possible combinations of processes that are at
least relatively common, e.g., dissociative recombination simply has the codes
for dissociation and for recombination.  Other examples of combinations of
codes are given in the final table.
