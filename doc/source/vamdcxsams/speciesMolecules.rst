Species.Molecules
======================

Molecules
-------------
	The element **Molecules** of type **MoleculesType** is a container for
	one or more **Molecule** elements  of type  **MoleculeType**.

	.. image:: images/molecules/Molecules.png

Molecule
-----------
	This element is defined as **MoleculeType**, which is an  extension of :ref:`PrimaryType`. 
	It provides all information  on  molecular chemical species through  **MolecularChemicalSpecies**
	of type **MolecularChemicalSpeciesType** and one or more elements **MolecularState** of type **MolecularStateType**. 
	These molecular species may be involved in various processes that are described in the **Processes** section.
	Referencing is done either by **speciesID** or **stateID** attributes, or both.

.. _MolecularChemicalSpecies:

MolecularChemicalSpecies
--------------------------

	The element **MolecularChemicalSpecies** describes a simple model to
	identify the chemical molecule involved in the description of **States** and
	**Processes**.

	.. image:: images/molecules/MolChemSpec.png
	

	NOTE: Recommendations on Organic and Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols and
	Terminology are available on the International Union of Pure and Applied
	Chemistry [IUPAC]_ webpage. 

	MolecularChemicalSpecies element has following child elements defined:

	*	**OrdinaryStructuralformula** mandatory element, of type :ref:`ReferencedTextType`.
		Standard formula describing the chemical complex written in Latex (molecule or molecular ion). 
		For the time being, the **ordinaryStructuralformula** element can not be used for search, because
		a worldwide consensus among molecular physicists is not reached yet.
		Here are some guidelines on how to fill this element, based on kind of molecule:

		-	For simple molecules involving several atoms, the formula should 
			reflect the order of the chemical bonds involved. 

			Isotopic atomic species should be described by the usual
			chemical element name (see :ref:`AtomsList`) with the *atomicMassNumber* as an upper left subscript. 
			For example: Carbon 13 would be $^{13}C$ (:math:`^{13}C`).
			
			For the special case of Hydrogen, isotopic atomic species have specific 
			symbols and names: Symbol= *D*  and Name= *Deuterium*  for core with 1 neutron and 1 proton,
			Symbol= *T*  and Name= *Tritium*  for core with 2 neutrons and 1 proton.
			
		-	When one or several radicals, such as methyl, :math:`CH_3`, are involved, 
			they should be indicated in bracket followed by the number of their occurence as a lower subscript. 
			They are placed in the formula following the order of the chemical bonds. 
			Sometimes the formula of the radical is replaced by an alias such
			as *(Me)* for methyl or *(Et)* for ethyl.

		-	The conformation (cis, trans, etc ...) should be indicated
			before the part of the formula giving the various atomic components.
			
		-	For more complex molecules, no general rules are provided for now
			in the document and any string describing the molecule can be used.  

		-	Molecular ions should be described by their chemical formula 
			followed by a plus/minus sign and the number of charges (when different from one).
			For example, the dyazenylium molecular ion would be $N_2H^+$
			(:math:`N_2H^+`) and the carbonyl doubly charged ion $CO^{2+}$ (:math:`CO^{2+}`).


	*	**StoichiometricFormula** mandatory string element.
		For molecules it is constituted by an alphabetical suite of the atomic constituents
		followed by the total number of their occurence (purely ASCII).
		For example: CH2O2 (:math:`CH_2O_2`) corresponding to formic acid
		whose formula is $t/c-HCOOH$ (:math:`t/c-HCOOH`).
		This is useful for a primary search of resources.

	*	**IonCharge** optional integer element. It gives the charge of the molecular ion. Examples: **+1** or **-1**

	*	**ChemicalName** element of type :ref:`ReferencedTextType`,
		a string (with reference) giving the name of the chemical complex. The **ChemicalName**
		element can not be used for search, but rather for information because different names 
		might be associated to a single chemical complex.

	*	**IUPACName** element, of type :ref:`ReferencedTextType`, a string (with reference) giving the IUPAC name. 
		It can be used for search.

	*	**URLFigure** optional element, that provides an URL to a figure showing the
		molecule in its stable configuration.

	*	**InChI** optional string element.
		Provides the InChI identifier. [InChI]_

	*	**InChIKey** *mandatory* string element.
		Provides the InChIKey hash of InChI identifier. This element is mandatory because InChIKeys 
		appeared to be the most convinient and relatively reliable way to identify if two Molecule blocks 
		of data, originating from different databases, are describing the same species or not.

	*	**CASRegistryNumber** optional element of type :ref:`ReferencedTextType` that
		provides the CAS Registry Number.

	*	**CNPIGroup** element of type :ref:`SymbolType`, that
		describes the Complete Nuclear Permutation Inversion Group.

	*	**PartitionFunction** element that may contain a temperature dependence of molecule partition function
		in a form of a list of points. May be specified multiple times.
		
		.. image:: images/molecules/PartFunc.png
		
		Extending :ref:`PrimaryType`, it has:
		
		-	**nuclearSpinIsomer** optional attribute to define nuclear spin isomer,
			the same way as in :ref:`MolecularStateCharacterisation`.
		-	**T** element of type :ref:`DataSeriesType` to define temperature points
		-	**Q** element of type :ref:`DataSeriesType` to define partition function values
	
	*	**MoleculeStructure** optional element that is a link to [CML]_ description of molecular structure.
		Extending :ref:`PrimaryType`, it defines additionally 
		
		-	optional **electronicStateRef** attribute of type :ref:`StateRefType`
			that may give a link to a separate description of electronic state,
		-	mandatory **atomArray** element from [CML]_, that must occur at least once,
		-	optional **bondArray** element from [CML]_, that may occur multiple times.
		
		This description should be sufficient to define the structure of any complex molecule.
	
	*	:ref:`NormalModes` element for description of vibrational normal modes of complex molecules.

	*	**StableMolecularProperties** element if type **MolecularPropertiesType** which
		provides information on properties of the molecule.
		
		.. image:: images/molecules/MolPropsType.png
		
		MolecularPropertiesType has two elements:
		
		-	**MolecularWeight**, of type :ref:`DataType`, that carries
			the sum of the individual isotopic masses of all the atoms in a molecule,
		-	multiple **OtherProperties** element of type :ref:`CharacterisationType`
			that allows to specify arbitrary properties of molecule in a form of a named dataset.
		
	*	**Comment** string element for arbitrary comments.


.. _MolecularState:

MolecularState
--------------------

	Formally a **MolecularState** element of type **MolecularStateType** is
	characterized by a single eigenvalue (possibly degenerate) and a single
	eigenstate (when non degenerate eigenvalue) of the hamiltonian  describing the
	energy structure of  the chemical compound. When the eigenvalue is
	degenerate, the quantum numbers associated to the degeneracy are not
	provided.

	The eigenvalue corresponds to the **StateEnergy**, and is  given relative to
	an **energyOrigin**.
	The eigenstate is characterized by a set of good quantum numbers, 
	such as parity and total angular momemtum, 
	and described by a wavefunction often expanded over some basis functions. 
	The expansion is characterized by a coupling scheme between the quantum
	numbers identifying individual basis functions.
	
	.. image:: images/molecules/MolecularState.png

	Following elements and attributes are defined for **MolecularState**
	
	*	**stateID** mandatory attribute, of type :ref:`StateIDType`, used for referencing the particular state.
	
	*	**fullyAssigned** optional boolean attribute, "true" defines that the state is fully described 
		by a set of good quantum numbers.

	*	optional **Description** string element, where arbitrary name of state can be given.

	*	optional :ref:`MolecularStateCharacterisation` element of type **MolecularStateCharacterisationType**
		that describes all quantities related to the molecular state apart from quantum numbers 
		(e.g. statistical weights, Land\'e factors, radiative lifetime of the level and other properties).

	*	optional **Parity** element, that gives the total parity of the level.
 		It is of type :ref:`ParityType`, a token taking the values *odd* or *even*. 

	*	optional **Case** element of type :ref:`BaseCase`, that is a container for [case-by-case]_ definition of quantum numbers.
	
	*	optional :ref:`StateExpansion` element that allows to describe the state as a superposition of
		basis quantum numbers sets, each set with it's own coefficient.

.. _MolecularStateCharacterisation:

MolecularStateCharacterisation
-----------------------------------

	.. image:: images/molecules/MolStaChar.png
	
	**MolecularStateCharacterisation** element, defined as **MolecularStateCharacterisationType**, describes all
	quantities related to the molecular state apart from it's quantum numbers.
	Following optional elements are defined:
	
	*	**StateEenrgy**, of type **StateEnergyType**. Defined as an extension of :ref:`DataType` with
		an additional optional string attribute **energyOrigin**. **energyOrigin** should contain a human
		readable string indicating the nature of the origin taken for the energy
		scale. For example, **energyOrigin**  might be *ground electronic*,
		*vibrational*, *rotational* state or could be *ionization energy* or *dissociation energy*.
		By physical meaning, state energy is the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian describing the species.
		
	*	**TotalStatisticalWeight** positive integer element, keeps statistical weight associated to the level,
		with all degeneracies (including nuclear spins).
	
	*	**NuclearStatisticalWeight** positive integer element, the same as **TotalStatisticalWeight** 
		but for nuclear spins only.
		
	*	**NuclearSpinIsomer**, a string indicating the type of nuclear spin symmetry. Possible
		values can be *para*, *ortho*, *meta*, *A*, *E*. This element is a comfort element very often used to
		classify levels.
		
	*	**Lifetime**, of type **LifeTimeType**. Defined as an extension of :ref:`DataType` with
		an additional mandatory attribute **decay** that may take values *total*, *totalRadiative*, *totalNonRadiative*,
		allowing to represent total state lifetime, including radiative and non-radiative decay mechanisms,
		or define them separately.
		
		Maximum of three occurences of this element is possible, each must have different value in **decay** attribute.
		
		When only discrete radiative decay is involved, it is given by
		:math:`\tau_i= \frac{1}{\sum_k A_{ik}}`
		
	*	**Parameters**, list of elements of :ref:`CharacterisationType`.
		It allows to add any additional characterisation of the molecular state.
		
		If data producer is intending to use this element, full description of data format and meaning
		should be given in one of the source references.
		
		As an example it can be used to describe a statistical weight 
		associated to the level including some degeneracies, but not all. In that 
		case the element "Parameter.Name" takes the value **PseudoStatisticalWeight**.
		It does not include all degeneracies and is used in fractions. 
		CDMS database provides such **PseudoStatisticalWeight**.
		

.. _CaseByCase:

Concept of cases
----------------------
	The case-by-case XML description of molecular states within XSAMS	
	is designed to provide a straightforward and flat data structure for representing 
	the quantum numbers and symmetries that denote a molecular state.
	For full documentation on cases see cbc-doc.pdf in docs folder of schema source.
	Schema source may be downloaded from http://xsams.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xsams/branches/vamdc-working/
	

.. _StateExpansion:

StateExpansion
'''''''''''''''''

	Each **MolecularState** has Case element of type **cases:BaseCase** from separate namespace.
	
	.. image:: images/molecules/StateExpansion.png
		:alt: case link to the main schema

.. _BaseCase:

BaseCase
'''''''''''

	**BaseCase** type defines the single attribute, *caseID*, that denotes the case used.
		
	.. image:: images/molecules/caseExample.png
		:alt: case definition example
		
	Each specific case, in turn, extends that **BaseCase** type, defining specific *caseID* attribute value
	and adding **QNs** element that contains a sequence of quantum numbers and symmetries.

''''''''''''''''''''''''

	To represent vibrational normal modes of molecules, **NormalModes** element is used.
	
	.. image:: images/molecules/NormalModes.png
	
	Each **NormalModes** element, extending :ref:`PrimaryType`, 
	may have an attribute **electronicStateRef**, defining reference to electronic state,
	and must have at least one **NormalMode** element, each defining a single mode.
