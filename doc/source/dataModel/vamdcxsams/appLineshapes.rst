Lineshapes dictionary
=========================

    Possible broadening and shifting names, lineshapes, parameters are listed below.
    The list is incomplete, it will be expanded before the release and extended later based on user requests and feedback.

Broadening names
------------------
    -   **pressure** for collisional broadening processes
    
    -   **doppler** for Doppler broadening
    
    -   **instrument** for instrument-specific broadening
    
    -   **natural** for line broadening caused by finite lifetime of initial and final states.
        Usually, Lorentzian line profile should be used.

Shifting names
------------------

    -   **pressure** for linear pressure shifting in hi-res spectroscopy

Lineshape names and parameters
--------------------------------

    -   Lorentzian
    
        *   gammaL
        
    -   Voigt
        
        *   gamma
        *   sigma
        
    to be continued...
