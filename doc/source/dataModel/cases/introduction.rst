Introduction

The 'case-by-case' XML description of molecular states within XSAMS is designed to provide a straightforward and
'flat' data structure for representing the quantum numbers and symmetries that
define a molecular state. As of version 0.3, 15 cases have been implemented,
covering the needs of various VAMDC member databases. Each case is
identified by a ``prefix`` and a ``version``, and belongs to the namespace given
(currently) by the URI `<http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapch0/XSAMS/cases/<prefix>/<version>>`_.
