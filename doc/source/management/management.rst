Introduction
====================

The collection of VAMDC documents and softwares is published on the VAMDC website (http://www.vamdc.org) under
the supervision of the VAMDC Document/Software Coordinator (hereafter refered as VDSC). 

The VAMDC Document/Software Coordinator is currently L. Nenadovic (CNRS).

Published items are of different kinds:
  - Schemas describing different data models
  - Auto-generated Documentation from schema
  - Documents describing standard procedures adopted within VAMDC
  - Softwares
  - Auto-Generated Documents from Software
  - Software Reference Guide


Software and Schemas version numbers
============================================

Version numbers of software and schemas can be independent of version numbers of
the related documents describing those softwares and schemas. 

Nevertheless auto-generated documentation from schema or software is directly linked to
the product they document and their version number is the same as the documented
product.

The version number for schemas is given by [#.#] starting at [0.1] and increasing
by 0.1 for each new update of the schemas.

The various softwares depend upon several standard procedures and schemas, that
are released within VAMDC at regular time. Whether softwares are updated or not at each release, 
the software version adopts the Release number, given by [Year.Months] (Year being the
last two digits of the running year).

Between the official VAMDC releases, the software version numbering would be constructed
with the previous Release number [Year.Months] and a revision number giving [Year.MonthsR#]

3. Version and Release Numbers in the VAMDC Document Collection

Auto-generated Documentation from schemas and from Softwares have the version number
of the corresponding schemas and softwares. 

All other documents have a version number given by their time of release. Whether the
documents are updated or not at each release, the document version adopts the Release number,
given by [Year.Months] (Year being the last two digits of the running year).

Between the official VAMDC releases, the document version numbering would be constructed
with the previous Release number [Year.Months] and a revision number giving [Year.MonthsR#]

Document Format
=====================

Authors are strongly encouraged to start from one of the VAMDC document templates (put a link
to the place where templates can be found), available in 
either Word or TeX. These help to ensure a common style and enables the VDSC to perform a 
lossless conversion to other common formats like PDF with minimum effort.

The VAMDC WP6 working group has adopted the use of SPHINX (put a link) in order to create easily
either PDF or HTML pages, and authors may want to use the same software in order to produce
homogeneous documentation for VAMDC.


How to Publish a Document
==============================

Documents are entered into the VAMDC document collection by the VDSC in response to a 
request from the Work Packages Leader or the person primarily responsible for editing a 
particular document. 

Documents are sent via zip directories to the VDC and publication occurs within
5 working days.


Working Drafts, Proposed Recommendation, Recommendation
=============================================================

VAMDC official documents begin as Working Drafts. Working Drafts are under the responsability
a Work Package working group.  Working Drafts may undergo numerous revisions during their development.  

Working Drafts will not be included in the formal VAMDC document collection, but rather will be 
maintained by the responsible working group on the VAMDC Document repository (GitHub).

Such works-in-progress should carry the version number of the previous recommendation with
the revision number [#.#r1], the status is set to "Working Draft" and the date is compulsory. 

Working Drafts should be developed, and utilize the above version numbering scheme, within 
the standard VAMDC document templates.

Once a Work package working group has reached internal agreement on a document, the
document becomes a Proposed Recommendation keeping its last labelling  [#.#r#], having
a status set to "Proposed Recommendation" and including the date.
The chair of the working group submits 
the Proposed Recommendation to the Document Coordinator for publication in the VAMDC 
Document Collection.  
If the Proposed Recommendation is amended, the version does not change, only the 
revision number and the date are updated. During this amendement period, the different
revisions are carried out on GitHub.

Once the Proposed Recommendation is accepted, the document becomes a Recommendation
document with the new version number, increased by 0.1 compared to previous
version, no revision number, a new date. Its status is "Recommended". 

The Recommended Documents are published at the the time of Release with Html and PDF
versions.

 
Document/Software Distribution
======================================

The VAMDC document/software collection is the primary source for VAMDC documents.  
VAMDC users, especially from outside the core collaboration, should always be directed 
to the document/software collection rather than be sent private copies of documents/softwares.

 
The Document/Software Collection
========================================

The VAMDC document/software collection keep track of the different Releases and Recommended 
Documents. The Proposed Recommendations are maintained on the VAMDC document/software collection
prior to recommendation, and are then removed when the document/software is approved.
All other revisions are kept on GitHub.
